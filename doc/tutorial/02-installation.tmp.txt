# Tutorial Part 1 - Installing Dynamics

First of all we need to install the plugin. The easiest way is to use the {@download?version=latest&format=archive&start=auto|latest release} and unpack it
into your project's plugins directory. If you're using symfony 1.1, the plugin is ready to go at this point. With symfony 1.2, which introduced explicit plugin
activation, you still have to edit your `ProjectConfiguration` class and enable `sfDynamicsPlugin`.


# Tutorial Part 2 - Having a look to configuration

Now, let me introduce a bit of configuration theory. The plugin bundles a bunch of configuration files, which are written in XML (for more information, see
{configuration|configuration chapter}). The only included configuration file by default, is dynamics.xml, which will include all other needed configuration
files using `import` clauses.

If you define a dynamics.xml file in your project configuration directory, the plugin's one will be completely ignored. Let's write the following one, 
including only bare dynamics packages and jquery vendor packages.

<dynamics>
  <import resource="dynamics-straight.xml" />
  <import resource="dynamics-jquery.xml" />
</dynamics>
