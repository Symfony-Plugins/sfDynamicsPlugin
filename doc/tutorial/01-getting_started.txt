# Tutorial Part 1 - Getting Started

Before we look further at each step needed to use the full power of the plugin, we're going to look at the jQuery Hello World example. 

You can open this example by looking at it directly on the documentation website, or by opening the `examples/jquery/000-hello-world/` directory found under the plugin root.

## Looking at the controller

First of all, open `action.class.php` and look at the `execute()` method. It's as simple as:

    [php]
    sfDynamics::load('jquery');

It asks sfDynamics to load the `jquery` package, after each of its dependances (if there are any). A `package` is not only one javascript file. It's a set of javascripts and stylesheets, a list of dependances and incompatible (conflicts) packages, and eventually a list of theming and i18n javascripts/stylesheets.

For now all you have to remember is that this line just made the jQuery library
