# import

## Description

`Import` tags are used to fetch configuration from other files. Importing files obey to few rules:

  * Imported `package`s replace already configured `package`s
  * If more than one file of the same name is present in the plugin, the project and the application, the one from application always
    takes precedence on the one from the project, which takes precedence on the one from the plugin.
  * An `import` clause will always include only one file, following the previous rule.

## Children nodes

## PHP definition
