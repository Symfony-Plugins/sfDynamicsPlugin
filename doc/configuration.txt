# Configuration

## Overview

sfDynamics configuration files are XML files describing javascript `packages`. Each `package` corresponds to a coherent list
of items, which works together. For further information about it, see the `package` reference below.

The only read file is `dynamics.xml`. By convention, it should only contain only `import` tags, to import configuration sets
defined in other files. For example, `dynamics-jquery.xml`, bundled with the plugin (but not included by default), provides
configuration/dependances relations between vendor jQuery libraries, jQuery UI and jQuery effects.

Our configuration system supports destructive inheritance between files. Default configuration is provided by the plugin, but it
will be completely ignored if you create a `dynamics.xml` file in your project's config directory. Again, if your application 
defines a `dynamics.xml`, the plugin will give it precedence and ignore everything else.


## sfDynamics plugins

When creating plugins, you often want to add features to thoose already existing, instead of replacing existing features by yours.
For this, you can create a `dynamics-plugin.xml` configuration file in your plugin's `config` directory using the same structure
as the main `dynamics.xml` file, but with a `dynamics-plugin` root node. Every package defined within this file will be prefixed
by the plugin's name. For example, if you define a `test` package in `sfTestPlugin`, it will be available as `sfTestPlugin.test`.

More information is available on the [extending Dynamics](/documentation/extending) page.
