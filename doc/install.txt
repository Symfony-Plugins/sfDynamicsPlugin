# Install

To install the plugin, you have two major options.

*TODO: This needs to be rewritten, and is maybe outdated*

## Use the latest release

The easiest way is to use the latest release available on [the symfony project plugin's page](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfDynamicsPlugin).
Thoose releases are heavily tested, and you're assured not to get anything broken by any subsequent release. Just use the plugin:install task on
it and you'll be done:

    [bash]
    php symfony plugin:install sfDynamicsPlugin

## Use a git branch

You can also use directly a git branch, by cloning the repository. Depending on if you want to install it for contribution or use, you should use either
the `master` branch (which can be unstable) or the `stable` branch, which will always match the latest release.

    [bash]
    git clone XXX...XXX master
    git clone XXX...XXX stable
