## Dynamics management

sfDynamicsPlugin manage assets via a symfony module, called sfDynamics (what a surprise). It adds an overhead (which you can get rid of, see
{{{packing}}}) but brings great flexibility on. Depending whether (XXX spelling?) sf_debug is true or false, additional javascript can be included
for debug, and scripts/stylesheets can be packed to enhance network traffic. It also adds the ability to generate javascript on runtime, for example
to include URLs based on your ProjectConfiguration.

Soon it will also provides support for theming and i18n, all scripts within a package for a given context (theme, language, or both) are packed together
in one html included javascript file.

Similar behavior is available for stylesheets to, to enhance filesize as much as possible.

## Load a package

Let's say you want to use a given package, named `myscript` in one of your modules. The only thing you have to do to get all its dependencies and files
included into your sfResponse is:

[php]
  sfDynamics::load('myscript');
[/php]

Easy wasn't it?
