# Welcome to sfDynamicsPlugin

Welcome on sfDynamicsPlugin homepage. This symfony plugin aims to revolution the way javascript is used in symfony projects. It supports
extensible configuration, library dependances, stylesheets, i18n, themes, packing, caching, and much more. To have a detailed explanation of
each features, please take a look at the <a href="<?php echo url_for('public/features'); ?>">features list</a>

This plugin is not bound to a specific javascript framework, and provides an easy way to use one set of scripts alltogether. For now, only configuration
files for jQuery and jQuery UI are provided, but our XML based configuration system allows to create different configuration packages describing
how each framework interacts with each of their associated libraries.

# Javascript frameworks

We're actively looking for configuration writers maintainers for all the following javascript frameworks:

 * Prototype + scriptaculous
 * Yahoo UI
 * ExtJS
 * Mootools
 * Dojo

To know what configuration packages looks like, have a look at the {{{configuration|configuration reference}}}.

If you're interested in contributing to the plugin, have a look at the {{{contribute|contribute page}}}.

# History

This plugin is a result of much tries all refactored into one robust implementation of what we believe will be a real enterprise ready
alternative to the yet unreplaced old school symfony 1.0 javascript helpers.
