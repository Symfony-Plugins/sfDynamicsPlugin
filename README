This plugin is under heavy refactoring. Please do not use for now.

sfDynamicsPlugin
================

Overview
--------
sfDynamicsPlugin is a symfony plugin aiming to manage javascript features within a project. It
supports js and css dependencies, javascript/css packing, theming, i18n, caching and more.

For now, the plugin is bundled with a set of libraries based on jQuery, jQuery UI and some
additional jQuery plugins, but will in the future support different sets of libraries.

We do not provide...
--------------------
The plugin does _not_ allow to switch transparently from a js framework to another transparently. It
does _not_ aim at abstracting javascript frameworks. Each has its pros and cons, and we don't want to
restrict each one's amazing features.

The plugin does _not_ provides helpers for common functions, like symfony 1.0 did. Javascript code is
written in javascript, so you don't have to learn a new PHP logic to write your scripts. It does not
simplify your life by allowing you to write JS without knowing anything of JS, but by doing so it
forces developpers to understand what their script do, and will save much time of debugging headaches.

We will provide in the future...
--------------------------------
Logging/firebug integration for debug mode.
