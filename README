sfDynamicsPlugin
================

Overview
--------
sfDynamicsPlugin is a js/css asset manager for the symfony framework.

It supports many cool features like dependencies and conflicts management,
packing and grouping, cache and supercache of packed assets, image path
rewriting.

For now, the plugin is bundled with a set of libraries based on jQuery, jQuery
UI and some additional jQuery plugins, but will in the future support different
sets of libraries.

If you're interested to work as a maintainer for <insert your favorite
framework here>, please contact us.
